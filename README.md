# Browser Refresh for Sublime Text

This plugin adds a keyboard shortcut to Sublime Text that will refresh the browser of your choice. Optionally the plugin can "auto save" your current file and bring the desired browser to the foreground.

The default keyboard shortcuts are:

- **⌘ + Shift + R** (Mac)
- **Ctrl + Shift + R** (Windows, Linux)

### 1. Install the package
**With the Package Control plugin**
The easiest way to install **Browser Refresh** is through Package Control, which can be found at [http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control).

```
Using Package Manager search for "Browser Refresh"
```

**Without Git**
Download the latest source from GitHub and copy the BrowserRefresh folder to your Sublime Text "Packages" directory.

**With Git**
Clone the repository in your Sublime Text "Packages" directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/gcollazo/BrowserRefresh-Sublime.git "Browser Refresh"
```

#### 1.1 On Linux
Install xdotool:

```
sudo apt-get install xdotool
```

### 2. Configure Key Bindings
You need to add the following to your `Key Bindings - User`. Go to `Preferences > Key Bindings - User` and add the following to that file and save. Without this step the plugin will not work.

```json
[
    {
        "keys": ["command+shift+r"], "command": "browser_refresh", "args": {
            "auto_save": true,
            "delay": 0.5,
            "activate": true,
            "browsers" : ["chrome"]
        }
    }
]
```

**auto_save**
If set to `true` you current file in Sublime Text will be saved before refreshing the browser window.

**delay**
Adds a delay (in seconds) before triggering the refresh. Seems to be useful if you are using a CSS or JavaScript pre-processor. The default is 0.0 seconds.

**activate**
If set to `true` when you press the keys it will bring the browser to the foreground. **Note:** On Windows this setting is always `true`.

**browsers**
Specify which browsers to refresh on command. The default is `chrome` which will try to refresh Google Chrome. You can change to be more specific using one of the following:

| Browser                   | Setting      | Platforms       |
|---------------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Google Chrome             | `chrome`     | Mac, Win, Linux |
| Google Chrome Canary      | `canary`     | Mac, Win        |
| Safari                    | `safari`     | Mac, Win        |
| Safari Technology Preview | `safari_pre` | Mac        	 |
| WebKit                    | `webkit`     | Mac             |
| Firefox                   | `firefox`    | Mac, Win, Linux |
| Firefox Developer Edition | `firefoxdev` | Mac             |
| Opera                     | `opera`      | Mac, Win        |
| Internet Explorer         | `ie`         | Win             |
| SRWare Iron               | `iron`       | Win             |
| Yandex                    | `yandex`     | Mac             |
